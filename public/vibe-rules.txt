# Figma Design Implementation Rules

## When implementing from Figma:
1. Always use Figma MCP server to get design context
2. Save components to: src/components/
3. Use TypeScript with strict mode
4. Style with Tailwind CSS
5. Extract design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
6. Make all components responsive
7. Include accessibility attributes
8. Use MUI Joy UI components from this Design System file: https://www.figma.com/design/aHM114L0PSvgiAl29fkXSD/MUI-for-Pathways?node-id=644-9517&t=MnFtNukEtUZjTmOQ-1

## File structure:
- Components: src/components/[Name].tsx
- Styles: src/components/[Name].module.css (if needed)
- Assets: public/images/

## Verification:
- Run `npm run lint` after generation
- Ensure TypeScript compiles without errors
